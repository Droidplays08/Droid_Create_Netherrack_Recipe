Introducing Droid's Create Netherrack Recipe

This is a Minecraft mod addon for the Create Mod. This mod allows you to have a renewable source of netherrack, using create mod components. This means you can now fully automate the creation of blaze cake, as well as other recipes involving cinder flour.

This mod creates 2 types of recipe for the creation of Netherrack. You can view them using JEI.

This is only for forge 1.20.1, and the Create mod is required.
